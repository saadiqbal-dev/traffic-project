## Architecture Overview

### Core System Architecture
The system is built around a **Unified Travel Time Calculator** that ensures consistent travel time calculations across all routing algorithms. This addresses a key research problem where different algorithms would apply congestion penalties inconsistently, leading to unrealistic comparisons.

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- **Single Source of Truth**: All algorithms use `UnifiedTravelTimeCalculator` for travel time calculations
- **Real London Network**: Uses OSMnx to load actual London street data (2,847 nodes, 7,234 edges)
- **MM1 Queuing Integration**: Real-time traffic flow modeling using mathematical queuing theory
- **Multi-Algorithm Comparison**: Simultaneous analysis of A*, Dijkstra, and Shortest Path algorithms

### Core Modules

**`unified_travel_time.py`** - Central travel time calculation system
- `UnifiedTravelTimeCalculator`: Physics-based travel time formulas
- `TravelTimeValidator`: Validates algorithm result consistency
- Research-based congestion penalty model (max 2.5x multiplier)

**`routing.py`** - Three routing algorithm implementations
- `enhanced_a_star_algorithm()`: Multi-criteria optimization (Congestion > Time > Distance)
- `enhanced_dijkstra_algorithm()`: Congestion-sensitive shortest path
- `shortest_path_algorithm()`: Distance-only baseline (ignores traffic)

**`models.py`** - Core data structures and London network loading
- `Vehicle` class: Stores paths, travel times, computation times for all algorithms
- `load_london_network()`: Loads cached or fresh London street data via OSMnx
- `add_realistic_london_speeds()`: Applies realistic speed limits to network edges

**`congestion.py`** - MM1 queuing model and traffic scenario management
- `calculate_mm1_congestion()`: Queuing theory-based congestion calculation
- `apply_consistent_congestion_scenario()`: Five traffic scenarios (Normal, Morning Rush, Evening Rush, Weekend, Special Events)
- `update_congestion_based_on_vehicles()`: Dynamic congestion updates based on vehicle placement

**`vehicle_management.py`** - Vehicle placement and tracking
- `add_bulk_vehicles()`: Smart vehicle placement with 70% bias toward notable locations
- `track_vehicle_congestion_impact()`: Monitors how vehicles affect network congestion
- Support for 200+ concurrent vehicles with stability monitoring

**`astar_ml_system.py`** - Machine learning optimization for A* algorithm
- `AStarDataCollector`: Collects training data across congestion scenarios
- `AStarPredictor`: RandomForest-based route prediction system
- `AStarMLGUI`: Tkinter interface for ML training and prediction

### Traffic Simulation Features

**Five Traffic Scenarios:**
- **Normal**: Baseline traffic (congestion 1.0-4.0)
- **Morning Rush**: Commuter patterns (congestion 1.5-4.0)
- **Evening Rush**: Peak congestion (congestion 2.0-4.0) 
- **Weekend**: Lighter, distributed traffic (congestion 1.0-3.0)
- **Special Events**: Variable intensity (congestion 1.0-5.0)

**Notable Locations System:**
- 10 evenly distributed landmarks across London
- Used for realistic vehicle source/destination selection
- Geographic hotspot algorithm for scenario-specific congestion

**Analysis and Reporting:**
- Excel export functionality with comprehensive statistics
- Real-time visualization with interactive congestion maps
- Stress testing framework supporting iterative vehicle addition
- MM1 queuing statistics including service rate degradation analysis

## Data Flow and Key Integrations

### Algorithm Comparison Workflow
1. Load London network via `load_london_network()`
2. Apply congestion scenario via `apply_consistent_congestion_scenario()`
3. Add vehicles using `add_bulk_vehicles()`
4. Calculate routes for all algorithms via `calculate_all_routes()`
5. Export analysis via `export_analysis_to_excel()`

### Unified Travel Time Integration
All algorithms call `UnifiedTravelTimeCalculator.calculate_edge_travel_time()` to ensure:
- Consistent physics-based calculations (Time = Distance / Speed)
- Realistic congestion penalties using research-based multipliers
- No double-penalty issues that plagued earlier implementations

### MM1 Queuing Integration
The system uses `calculate_mm1_congestion()` to model realistic traffic flow:
- Arrival rate (λ) and service rate (μ) calculations
- Utilization factor ρ = λ/μ with stability monitoring
- Service rate degradation based on congestion impact
- Queue length and wait time calculations

## Output Structure

The system creates structured output in `london_simulation/`:
- `excel_data/` - Congestion analysis exports
- `scenario_maps/` - Visualization maps showing routes and congestion
- `analysis_reports/` - Comprehensive algorithm comparison reports
- `impact_reports/` - Vehicle congestion impact studies
- `stress_test_reports/` - Progressive stress test results
- `astar_ml_data/` - Machine learning training datasets
- `astar_models/` - Trained ML model files

## System Validation

The system includes comprehensive validation:
- **Travel Time Realism**: Validates London speeds (8-40 km/h range)
- **Algorithm Consistency**: Ensures reasonable travel time ratios between algorithms
- **System Stability**: MM1 model prevents infinite queues (ρ < 1.0 monitoring)
