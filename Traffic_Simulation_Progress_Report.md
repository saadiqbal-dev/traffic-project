## Slide 5: Phase 3 - Travel Time Calculation System
**Timeline: Mathematical Foundation Development**

### Unified Travel Time Calculator - Key Innovation

#### Core Physics Formula
```
Travel Time = Distance / Speed
Time (seconds) = Length (meters) / (Speed (km/h) × 1000/3600)
```

#### Congestion Penalty Model
**Research-Based Multipliers:**
- Light Traffic (1-2): 1.0-1.1× (0-10% penalty)
- Moderate Traffic (3-4): 1.1-1.3× (10-30% penalty)  
- Heavy Traffic (5-6): 1.3-1.6× (30-60% penalty)
- Severe Traffic (7-8): 1.6-2.0× (60-100% penalty)
- Gridlock (9-10): 2.0-2.5× (100-150% penalty, capped)

#### Mathematical Implementation
```python
def calculate_congestion_multiplier(congestion_level):
    if congestion_level <= 2.0:
        return 1.0 + (congestion_level - 1.0) * 0.1
    elif congestion_level <= 4.0:
        return 1.1 + (congestion_level - 2.0) * 0.1
    # ... progressive penalty scaling
```

## Slide 6: Phase 4 - Traffic Flow Modeling
**Timeline: Advanced Congestion Implementation**

- **Average Vehicles in System:** L = ρ/(1-ρ)
- **Average Time in System:** W = 1/(μ(1-ρ))
- **Average Queue Length:** Lq = ρ²/(1-ρ)

#### Service Rate Degradation Model
```python
# Higher congestion = Lower service rate
degradation_factor = 0.1 + (0.4 * congestion_impact)
adjusted_service_rate = base_service_rate * (1.0 - degradation_factor + 0.1)
```
